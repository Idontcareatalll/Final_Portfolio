        Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine. 
        <br>
        The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms. 
        <br>
        It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development, is considered easy to use for beginner developers, and is popular for indie game development.
